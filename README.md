# Interception-Simulation
This program visually simulates the interception of a moving projectile by a launcher on a 2D plane. The projectile moves from an initial point to a target at a constant speed, while the launcher attempts to intercept it from a fixed position with its own constant speed. The simulation calculates the required interception point and angle based on motion equations, updating the positions in real-time. If successful, the program displays a message indicating interception; otherwise, it reports failure. The GUI features a dynamic visualization of both paths, aiding in understanding the interception dynamics.
